So paste this script into the console of your checkout doordash order
make sure the url starts in "https://www.doordash.com/consumer/checkout/"
and it uses ai to check the page for your meal items and it uses "CalorieNinja" to get the calories of the food
and based on how many calories are in the food and how long it takes to walk of your meal.

Sign up for CalorieNinja
go to "https://calorieninjas.com/"
and get api key
and switch "your-api-key" in code and paste it

I will soon turn this to google extension
